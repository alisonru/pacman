# Pacman

One of my very first Javascript exercises, this assignment was an exercise in understanding basic Javascript logic, loops and page width/boundaries. We were provided with four pacman images (but after my kid pointed out that Pacman doesn't have an eye, I updated the image to be a little more clean and classic).

## Installation

Upon cloning the files launch the HTML file in the browser of your choice. The pacman should travel from left to right then turn and reverse (and repeat!) once it hits the page bounds.  

## Future Improvements

I'd like to add a button that randomly generates fruit in the pacman's path that disappear upon collision.
